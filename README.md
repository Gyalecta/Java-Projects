# Why am I doing this?

I was never a fervent fan of Java, and I always criticized it a lot. So I decided to give it a try. The only thing I can say about that language is "wow!". When I tried it, I realized that all my criticisms were silly and unfounded. Indeed, a good Software Engineer must be capable of using several languages and adapting to the environment in which he works. Within this repository, I will publish all the projects I will do with Java, from the simplest to the most complex.
